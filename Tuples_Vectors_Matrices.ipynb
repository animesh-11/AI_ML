        "In the healthcare sector, maintaining secure and immutable records is crucial for patient confidentiality and data integrity. This is why medical records are often stored in tuples: their immutability ensures that patient data cannot be accidentally altered. However, there are situations where modification is necessary, such as when there is a misdiagnosis, an error in personal details, or an update to treatment plans. In these rare cases, the tuple data needs to be converted into a list for modification, and then back to a tuple to restore the security and immutability of the data.\n",
